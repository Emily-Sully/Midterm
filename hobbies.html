        <h2>My Favorite Hobby: Traveling</h2>
        <p>
            One of my absolute favorite things to do is travel with my friends and family. Whether it's a beach getaway or a mountain escape, I find joy and peace in exploring new places and making memories with the people I love.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Family Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Family is everything to me. I'm in a family of six with mom, dad, an older sister, and two triplet siblings. I'm incredibly lucky to be a triplet, which is something that always amazes people! Growing up with two siblings the same age has been a unique and wonderful part of my life. We've shared every milestone together and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
